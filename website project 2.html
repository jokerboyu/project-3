<h1  id="ch1" style="margin-top:110px"> <u> What is artificial intelligence </u></h1>


<p class="p" style="margin-top:10px">  It is the ability of <a  href="website project 3.html" style="font-size:20px"> computers </a>  to imitate human's <a href=" website project 4.html" style="font-size:20px"> intelligent </a> behavior. The term is frequently applied to the developing of systems that contains intellectual processes using characteristic <img align="right" src="https://www.fingent.com/wp-content/uploads/fingent-5-1024x555.jpg" width="30%" height="40%">of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great proficiency. </p>







<p class="p">  Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. AI includes machine learning via deep learning. The former refers to machines automatically learning from existing data without being assisted by human beings. Deep learning allows the machine to absorb huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, and audio.
Any AI system must be able to have some of the following characteristics: Observation, analytical ability, problem solving, learning, etc.  </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

<h1 id="ch2" align="center"> <u> History </u></h1>
<p class="p"> <img align="right" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alan-turing-9512017-1-402.jpg"> One such person was <a  href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alan-Turing" style="font-size:20px">Alan Turing</a>, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing? This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence.The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing. In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols.The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s stored-program concept, and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s conception is now known simply as the universal Turing machine.All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines. </p>

<h2 id="hi"style="color:red"> The turring test </h2>

<p class="p">
In 1950 Turing sidestepped the traditional debate concerning the definition of intelligence, introducing a practical test for computer intelligence that is now known simply as the Turing test. The Turing test involves three participants: a computer, a human interrogator, and a human foil. The interrogator attempts to determine, by asking questions of the other two participants, which is the computer. All communication is via keyboard and display screen. The interrogator may ask questions as penetrating and wide-ranging as he or she likes, and the computer is permitted to do everything possible to force a wrong identification. (For instance, the computer might answer, “No,” in response to, “Are you a computer?” and might follow a request to multiply one large number by another with a long pause and an incorrect answer.) The foil must help the interrogator to make a correct identification.

<h1 id="ch2" align="center" > <u> Difference between AI and machine learning </u> </h1>

<p class="p"> Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of the broader category of AI.<img align="right" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/ai-vs-machine-learning.png" width="30%">

Put in context, artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data. </p>

 


<p class="p">Computer programmers and software developers enable computers to analyze data and solve problems — essentially, they create artificial intelligence systems — by applying tools such as: </p>

<ul style="margin-left:190px;">
<li> Machine learning</li>
<li> Deep learning </li>
<li> Neural networks</li>
<li>computer vision </li>
<li> natural language processing</li>
</ul>

<br> <br> <br> <br>
<h1 id="ch3" align="center" style="margin-left:190px;"> <u> Difference between machine learning and deep learning </u> </h1>
<p class="p"> Machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI. In short, machine learning is AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of the human brain.

these are some of the key differences:</p>

<h2 id="ch4" style="margin-left:190px;"> What is machine learning </h2>
<p class="p"> Machine learning refers to the study of computer systems that learn and adapt automatically from experience, without being explicitly programmed.

With simple AI, a programmer can tell a machine how to respond to various sets of instructions by hand-coding each “decision.” With machine learning models, computer scientists can “train” a machine by feeding it large amounts of data. The machine follows a set of rules—called an algorithm—to analyze and draw inferences from the data. The more data the machine parses, the better it can become at performing a task or making a decision.</p>

<h2 id="ch5" style="margin-left:190px"> What is deep learning</h2>

<p class="p">Where machine learning algorithms generally need human correction when they get something wrong, deep learning algorithms can improve their outcomes through repetition, without human intervention. A machine learning algorithm can learn from relatively small sets of data, but a deep learning algorithm requires big data sets that might include diverse and unstructured data.

Think of deep learning as an evolution of machine learning. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that layers algorithms and computing units—or neurons—into what is called an artificial neural network. These deep neural networks take inspiration from the structure of the human brain. Data passes through this web of interconnected algorithms in a non-linear fashion, much like how our brains process information.  </p>
