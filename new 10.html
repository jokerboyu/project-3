<p style="font-size:24px"> Management information systems (MIS) is a changing and challenging field. Modern businesses can’t survive for long without using some sort of MIS to manage massive amounts of data, and there are plenty of opportunities to study or work in the discipline. In this article, we’ll cover what is happening with MIS in both business and academia. You’ll learn about what constitutes an MIS, their origin and evolution, their capabilities, and also gain insights from experts in the field.</p>

<p style="text-align:center" "font-size:20px"> What Is a Management Information System?
In business, management information systems (or information management systems) are tools used to support processes, operations, intelligence,<br> and IT. MIS tools move data and manage information.They are the core of the information management discipline and are often considered the first systems of the information age.MIS produce<br> data-driven reports that help businesses make the right decisions at the right time. While MIS overlaps with other business disciplines, there are some differences:</p>

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): This discipline ensures that all departmental systems are integrated. MIS uses those connected systems to access data to create reports. 
IT Management: This department oversees the installation and maintenance of hardware and software that are parts of the MIS. The distinction between the two has always been fuzzy.
E-commerce: E-commerce activity provides data that the MIS uses. In turn, the MIS reports based on this data affect e-commerce processes. </p>
<p> Maeve Cummings, Co-author of Management Information Systems for the Information Age and Professor of Accounting & Computer Information Systems at Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, explains how MIS functions in academia. “[Management information systems is] the study of computers and computing in a business environment. Computer science focuses on the machine while information systems, or management information systems, focuses on how IT can support the strategy and operation of organizations,” she explains.

The concept includes what computers can do in this field, how people process information, and how best to make it accessible and up-to-date. Cummings adds, “The ‘right information in the right place at the right time’ is what we are striving for. This discipline is much more eclectic than straight computer science.” 

Besides computer science, there are fields of study that overlap with MIS, both at the theoretical and practical levels:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Information Systems (IS):</strong> In IS, there is a greater emphasis on tools, while MIS places more emphasis on business processes and operations. </li>
<li> <strong> Information Technology (IT):</strong> IT is similar to IS, but it focuses solely on computers.</li>
<li> <strong> Informatics:</strong> A discipline that combines software engineering, information systems development, and networking.  </li>
<li> <strong> Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering:</strong> These fields focus on the development and improvement of hardware and software, respectively. MIS helps determine the practical and theoretical implications of these changes. </li>

<h2 style="text-align:center"> Categories of Management Information Systems</h2>
<p> Management information system is a broad term that incorporates many specialized systems. The major types of systems include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Executive Information System (EIS): Senior management use an EIS to make decisions that affect the entire organization. Executives need high-level data with the ability to drill down as necessary.  </li>
<li> Marketing Information System (MkIS): Marketing teams use MkIS to report on the effectiveness of past and current campaigns and use the lessons learned to plan future campaigns.</li>
<li>Business Intelligence System (BIS): Operations use a BIS to make business decisions based on the collection, integration, and analysis of the collected data and information. This system is similar to EIS, but both lower level managers and executives use it.  </li>
<li> Customer Relationship Management System (CRM): A CRM system stores key information about customers, including previous sales, contact information, and sales opportunities. Marketing, customer service, sales, and business development teams often use CRM.</li>
<li> Sales Force Automation System (SFA): A specialized component of a CRM system that automates many tasks that a sales team performs. It can include contact management, lead tracking and generation, and order management.</li>
<li>Transaction Processing System (TPS): An MIS that completes a sale and manages related details. On a basic level, a TPS could be a point of sale (POS) system, or a system that allows a traveller to search for a hotel and include room options, such as price range, the type and number of beds, or a swimming pool, and then select and book it. Employees can use the data created to report on usage trends and track sales over time. </li>
<li>Knowledge Management System (KMS): Customer service can use a KM system to answer questions and troubleshoot problems.  </li>
<li> Financial Accounting System (FAS): This MIS is specific to departments dealing with finances and accounting, such as accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR).</li>
<li> Human Resource Management System (HRMS): This system tracks employee performance records and payroll data.</li>
<li>Supply Chain Management System (SCM): Manufacturing companies use SCM to track the flow of resources, materials, and services from purchase until final products are shipped.   </li>
